# geo-2024-notebooks

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and some data for analyzing how we are assigning placenames as part of the [gis-robot-suite] workflow. It was done as part of the [DLSS Geo Workcycle 2024](https://github.com/orgs/sul-dlss/projects/49/) specifically [#744](https://github.com/sul-dlss/gis-robot-suite/issues/744).

To use it you should be able to:

1. install Python
2. `pip install poetry`
3. `poetry run jupyter notebook`
